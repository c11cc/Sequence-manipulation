## gc_data.plx<br>
this is a script for calculating the GC content of settled length around target site at a box length continuously (from the first base to the last base of the settled region with the box length as counting unit);<br>
desired site infomation file contains chromosome and site infomation in the first and second column,no headings; <br>
desired sequence file is in .fa format, with chrmosome id after >;<br>
desired region should be smaller than the length of the sequence;<br>
GC box length is the length of the region for calculating GC content.<br>

## seq_extract.plx
